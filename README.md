# Montana Cost-Of-Living-API

Describe your app here. (What is your 1 minute “elevator pitch” of your capstone project? What problem does it solve? What inspired you to build it?)

Describe the technologies you used to build your app (Ruby on Rails backend, React.js frontend, any libraries, APIs, etc.)

Optional: Add screenshots or gifs of your application

## Installation

```bash
bundle install
rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

## Usage

```bash
rails server
```

Then visit 'localhost:3000/cities.json' to view what the API is returning on the backend.

You can also test web requests as documented in the `requests.http` file.

## Future Plans

List any ideas you plan on implementing in the future.
